## Usage

## Development / Contributing

Make sure you are in the top-level directory ("InteractiveEuler"). 

To run the main program, type (`$` refers to command line prompt)

`$ python interactiveeuler`

To run all unit tests, type

`$ python -m unittest -v`

(the `-v` option stands for "verbose" and lists each test that is run)

We will eventually probably use sphinx for documentation.
